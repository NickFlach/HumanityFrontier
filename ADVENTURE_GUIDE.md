## 🎭 **Narrative & Lore**

### **The Quantum Priests of Alexandria**

Long before modern cryptography, the Quantum Priests understood that information could exist in multiple states simultaneously. They wore the Bell State Amulet and spoke in ciphers that collapsed into meaning only when observed by the initiated.

### **Indra's Net**

Ancient Vedic texts described a cosmic web where each jewel reflects all others infinitely. You've recreated this quantum network through entanglement, proving the ancients understood what we're only now rediscovering.

### **The Temporal Paradox**

Time doesn't flow—it crystallizes. Every quantum operation you perform creates a new timeline branch. Navigate carefully, or you'll find yourself lost between moments that never were and always will be.

### **The Forbidden Knowledge**

Some knowledge was sealed away for good reason. The Akashic Records contain every quantum operation ever performed across all timelines. Access comes with a price: the burden of omniscience.
